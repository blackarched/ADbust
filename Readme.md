Selenium Automation Script with Enhanced Features
Overview
This script is a sophisticated automation tool built using Selenium. It allows users to interact with websites in a fully automated manner, including handling dynamic content, playing ad videos, completing tasks, and handling cookie pop-ups. It is designed with maximum user-friendliness, automation, usability, and stability, ensuring it is accessible to both novice and experienced users.

The script is Termux-compatible and includes advanced features such as parallel task execution, dynamic retries, and an interactive setup wizard to streamline the user experience.

Features
Automated Ad Handling

Plays ad videos and waits for completion.
Customizable ad duration for flexibility.
Task Automation

Sequential or parallel task execution with retries for failed tasks.
Dynamic delays between tasks to mimic human behavior.
Cookie Consent Handling

Automatically accepts cookie consent pop-ups if required.
Interactive Configuration

First-time users can create a config.ini file with an interactive setup wizard.
Options for setting URL, selectors, headless mode, and more.
Dynamic Error Handling

Handles stale elements, interactability issues, and timeouts with robust retry mechanisms.
Logs all actions and errors for easy troubleshooting.
Parallel Task Execution

Speeds up task completion by processing tasks concurrently using multiple threads.
Extensive Logging

Logs all actions, warnings, and errors to a file for transparency and troubleshooting.
User-Friendly Enhancements

Configurable via config.ini.
Automatically validates configuration and dependencies.
Termux Compatibility

Fully compatible with low-resource environments like Termux.
Runs in headless mode for seamless execution.
Installation Guide
Step 1: Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed:

Python 3.8+
Install Python via your package manager or download it from Python.org.

Pip
Pip is usually bundled with Python. Verify by running:

bash
Copy code
pip --version
Google Chrome
Download and install Chrome from Google Chrome.

ChromeDriver
Ensure the ChromeDriver version matches your Chrome browser version. Download from ChromeDriver Downloads.

Step 2: Clone the Repository
Clone this repository or download the script directly.

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_folder>
Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries using the provided requirements.txt:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 4: Generate Configuration
Run the script to generate config.ini interactively:

bash
Copy code
python automation_script.py --setup
Follow the prompts to configure:

Target URL
CSS selectors for elements
Ad duration
Headless mode
Delay range, retries, etc.
Step 5: Run the Script
Run the script with:

bash
Copy code
python automation_script.py
Optional Arguments
Argument	Description
--setup	Launches the interactive setup wizard.
--parallel	Enables parallel task execution (faster).
--log-level <level>	Sets logging verbosity (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR).
Detailed Instructions
1. Playing Ad Videos
The script automatically plays the ad video using the specified CSS selector.
It waits for the duration specified in the configuration.
2. Completing Tasks
Tasks are identified using the completion_task_selector provided in the configuration.
You can choose between sequential or parallel task execution.
Each task is clicked, with dynamic retries in case of failure.
3. Handling Cookie Consent
If a cookie consent pop-up is present, it will automatically be accepted using the specified selector.
4. Customizing Delays
Delays between tasks can be customized to mimic human-like behavior.
Specify a range (e.g., 2-5 seconds) in the configuration.
Troubleshooting
Common Issues and Fixes
Issue	Fix
ChromeDriver validation failed	Ensure ChromeDriver is installed and matches your Chrome version.
TimeoutException: Element not found	Verify the CSS selectors in your config.ini. Use developer tools (F12) to check.
Permission denied on Termux	Run termux-setup-storage to allow storage access and install required packages.
ModuleNotFoundError	Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install missing dependencies.
Script exits after launch	Check the log file for errors and verify configuration.
Error Logs
Errors and warnings are saved to a log file (automation_log.log). Use this to identify and resolve issues.

Advanced Configuration
Modify config.ini for advanced settings:

ini
Copy code
[SETTINGS]
url = https://example.com
ad_video_selector = .ad-video
completion_task_selector = .completion-task
cookie_consent_selector = #cookie-accept
ad_duration = 30
headless_mode = yes
task_retry_count = 3
delay_between_tasks = 2-5

[ADVANCED]
chromedriver_path = /path/to/chromedriver
window_size = 1920x1080
log_level = INFO
log_file = automation_log.log
Features in Detail
Interactive Setup Wizard
First-time users can create config.ini without manual editing.
Prompts ensure all required fields are set correctly.
Task Execution Options
Sequential Mode
Tasks are completed one at a time, suitable for simple workflows.
Parallel Mode
Tasks are distributed across threads for faster execution.
Resilient Error Handling
Retires failed tasks with exponential backoff.
Logs errors with detailed descriptions for debugging.
Headless Mode
Allows the script to run in environments without a graphical interface, like Termux.
Frequently Asked Questions
How do I update ChromeDriver?
Visit ChromeDriver Downloads, download the version matching your browser, and replace the existing file.

Can I run this on Termux?
Yes. Install required packages using pkg:

bash
Copy code
pkg install python
pkg install chromedriver
What if the script doesn’t click elements correctly?
Verify selectors using the browser’s Developer Tools (F12). Update the config.ini file with the correct selectors.
